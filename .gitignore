# Specific raw data file to ignore
# Use forward slashes for paths in .gitignore, even on Windows, for better cross-platform compatibility.
02_Data_Collection_and_Preperation/Raw_Data/stock-level factors.csv

# Specific text file to ignore (assuming it's in the root directory)
text.txt

# You might also want to ignore all contents of Raw_Data if it's all large datasets
# For example, to ignore all CSV files in that specific Raw_Data folder:
# 02_Data_Collection_and_Preperation/Raw_Data/*.csv

# If you have other large data folders or temporary build folders, add them here too.
# Example:
# /02_Data_Collection_and_Preperation/Raw_Data/
# /some_other_large_data_folder/
# *.log
# *.tmp
