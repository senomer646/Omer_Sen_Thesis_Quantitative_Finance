I have extracted the monthly returns of the SP 500 constituents from 1965 to 2024 from the CRSP database.

I have also extracted the 153 characteristics of all US stocks from 1965 to 2024 from the WRDS database.

I will merge the two datasets on permno and date, to create a dataset with the returns of the SP 500 constituents and their characteristics.
